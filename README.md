# Flux
Flux is a reimagining of the classic 2048 sliding puzzle as an energy system. Instead of chasing exponential growth, players must manage energy, instability, and entropy to keep the system alive.

## Gameplay Overview
Flux is played on a familiar 4×4 grid. Tiles slide and merge like in 2048, but every action consumes energy. Merging tiles costs additional energy based on their value. High-value tiles become unstable, leaking energy over time. The challenge is no longer “reach the biggest number,” but:

## How to Play
- Use arrow keys to slide tiles
- Watch your energy bar
- Avoid excessive instability
- Survive as long as possible without collapse
